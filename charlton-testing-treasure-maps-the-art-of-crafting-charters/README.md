# Testing Treasure Maps: The Art of Crafting Charters

**Speaker:** Jenna Charlton

## Abstract

Testing with a script is like using GPS, but testing with a charter is like following a treasure map.

At the heart of exploratory testing is the charter. Charters should guide our testing and help us focus our exploration on what's most important and impactful. Unlike scripts generated for test cases, there's an art to crafting charters. Charters help us avoid the dragon of wasteful testing or getting lost in the labyrinth of distraction to help us reach the treasure chest of good enough quality.

We'll discuss adventuring our way through heuristics, assembling our party (personas), side quests to encourage exploration, navigating your way through a test session, and using your compass to help you get back on track. 

What You'll Learn:
- Using heuristics in exploratory testing
- Using personas in charters
- Language that invites exploration
- Using charters to avoid scope creep
