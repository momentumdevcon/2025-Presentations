# Boost Your Team�s Bus Factor: Creating Docs That Work

**Speaker:** Keith Wedinger

## Abstract

Is your team struggling with undocumented knowledge, repeating the same conversations, or relying on tribal memory? You might be in an invisible documentation crisis�where critical information is lost even without anyone leaving. If this sounds familiar, you�re not alone.
 
Great documentation can be the difference between a thriving team and a knowledge black hole, but getting buy-in isn�t always easy. In this session, you�ll learn how to sell the value of good documentation and, more importantly, how to create living documentation that stays relevant�without becoming a maintenance burden.
 
We�ll cover:
- What makes documentation effective (and what makes it fail)
- How to avoid �dead docs��just like dead code
- Practical techniques to integrate documentation into your workflow
- Real-world examples of documentation that actually works
 
By the end, you�ll have actionable strategies to increase your project�s bus factor and ensure your team never loses knowledge again. Don�t let documentation be an afterthought�come learn how to make it a game-changer.
