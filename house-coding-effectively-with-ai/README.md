# Coding Effectively with AI

**Speaker:** Cory House

## Abstract

It seems everyone is coding with AI assistance these days. But how do we do so effectively? And how do we pick between dozens of approaches? We'll explore picking an editor vs using a CLI, choosing models, configuration techniques for optimizing outputs, creating custom agents, handling requirements, code review workflows, using and configuring MCP servers, seven levels of AI assistance, implementing hooks, spec driven development, context management, prompting techniques, learning modes, implementing tests via AI, and more. Attendees will walk away with a variety of new ideas to consider and a mental model for how to choose between them.
