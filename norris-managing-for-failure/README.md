# Managing for Failure

**Speaker:** Amy Norris

## Abstract

Oh no! Your team is doing a fabulous job. You never have to have difficult conversations, everyone is getting their work done to a high standard and on time. The higher ups are super happy with you. No one on your team has failed in longer than you can remember! How could you let this happen and what can you do to fix it?

Failure is an important part of growing your team - both the individuals on it and the cohesiveness of the whole. Without it creative problem solving can stagnate, learning slows to a crawl, and the work you get done is less than it could have been. 

We�ll dive in to strategies for helping your team (including you!) feel comfortable with failure, as well as strategies for keeping YOUR boss happy when it happens. We�ll also explore low-stakes ways to introduce failure into your team, so you�re not taking down prod to prove a point.
