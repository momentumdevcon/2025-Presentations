# Intro to Temporal: JS Dates That Do Not Suck

**Speaker:** Bruce Hubbard

## Abstract

Temporal is a new ECMAScript stage 3 proposal for handling dates (and times!) that will be built-in to the language and forever change how dates are handled in JavaScript. Finally after 20 years handling dates in JavaScript without a third party library will no longer suck! In this talk we'll go over all of the new types and utility methods in Temporal and how to use them and talk about when you can start using it in production.

**Note:** The speaker has not uploaded any slides or resources.
