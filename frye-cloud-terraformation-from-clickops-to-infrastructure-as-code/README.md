# Cloud Terraformation: From ClickOps to infrastructure as code

**Speaker:** Victor Frye

## Abstract

Is your cloud environment a warm and inviting habitat or a fragile ecosystem everyone is afraid to touch? The migration to the cloud rarely starts with best practices. Every company has shameful infrastructure that was manually configured. However, at some point we decide our infrastructure needs planetary-level alteration. Whether it is for engineering a consistent platform for deploying applications or to preserve desired state and prevent drift, we say we�re going to start the conversion soon. We want that infrastructure as code (IaC) terraformation.

In this session, we will explore Terraform, a declarative language for IaC. Join us as we terraform a production application in Azure from existing ClickOps resources to codified infrastructure. We�ll go through the process of exporting resources and refactoring the result for future administration. We might even break production as we test our new code.

Whether you are new to the cloud or a DevOps expert, you will chart your course from this demonstration with a clear trajectory towards your infrastructure as code journey.
