# The Future of Code Reviews: Will Humans Still Be Needed?

**Speaker:** Avindra Fernando

## Abstract

What if AI could handle code reviews for you? With AI agents now capable of reviewing code, developers can save a huge amount of time. But what does this mean for human-led code reviews?

Tools like Copilot, Qudo Merge, CodeRabbit, and DeepCode are already helping developers catch bugs, improve code quality, and suggest better patterns. AI can speed up reviews and reduce manual effort, but human oversight is still essential. While AI is great at spotting errors and suggesting improvements, it has limitations when it comes to understanding context, architectural decisions, and long-term code maintainability.

Join me in this session as we explore what the future of code reviews could look like. You will walk away with insights on how AI and human reviewers can work together to improve the development process.
