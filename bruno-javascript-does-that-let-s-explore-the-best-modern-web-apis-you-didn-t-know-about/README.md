# JavaScript Does THAT!? Let's Explore the Best Modern Web APIs You Didn�t Know About

**Speaker:** Brandon Bruno

## Abstract

For decades, developers have been using JavaScript to interact with the DOM - hiding elements, sorting tables, and adding interactivity. But today's JavaScript goes far beyond that: dozens of flexible Web APIs let JavaScript tap into native device functionality and advanced features. In this session, live demos and code samples will showcase powerful APIs for sending notifications, storing rich data, triggering device vibrations, fetching content, capturing inking data, detecting idle status, reading game controller input, and more. You'll leave ready to experiment with some of the latest and most innovative JavaScript Web APIs in your own projects.
