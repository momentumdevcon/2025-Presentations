# WebAssembly beyond the browser: a better way to build extensible software

**Speaker:** Chris Nelson

## Abstract

The WebAssembly component model brings a rich, language agnostic type system to WebAssembly and makes it practical for server side application development. Programming languages that are able to target WebAssembly components include Python, C/C++/C#, javascript, rust, and go, with additional languages being rapidly added to this list. Taken together, all this means we have a better way to let users extend our software. Where we used to do an awkward dance of webhooks and API calls, we can now safely (due the no-privilege by default nature of WebAssembly) host and execute user code within our application. In this session, we�ll see how projects like NGINX are embracing WASM components for extending their system. We�ll learn how to build and host WASM components in multiple languages with code examples so you can add WASM component support to your next application.
