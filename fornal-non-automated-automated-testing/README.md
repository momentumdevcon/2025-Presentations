# Non-Automated Automated Testing

**Speaker:** Bob Fornal

## Abstract

There are times when simple manual testing and Smoke Testing isn�t enough. Are you doing production releases with hundreds of affected pages? Or are you migrating thousands of pages from one platform to another?

Smoke testing might not be enough for all deployment scenarios. In particular, when doing manual late-night deployments and having developers "manually" test the changes being implemented, there is a lot of room for failure. This talk will cover ways to reduce the possibility of failure.

This talk will cover some scenarios and ways to build automation with manual verification steps that can stabilize tricky releases. We will work through a few known scenarios and ways I�ve mitigated these issues in unusual �automated� ways.
