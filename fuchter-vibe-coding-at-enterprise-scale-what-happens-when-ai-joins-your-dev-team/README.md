# Vibe Coding at Enterprise Scale: What Happens When AI Joins Your Dev Team

**Speaker:** Wesley Fuchter

## Abstract

What if you let AI code alongside your devs�would it speed things up or slow them down? At Modus Create, we ran a 3-month internal experiment to find out. Two squads were tasked with building the same app: one squad had full access to AI coding agents like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, while the other worked with zero AI assistance. The results? Surprising, nuanced, and extremely relevant for any enterprise thinking about bringing AI tools into their software delivery process. In this session, we'll share productivity metrics, insights on code quality, cultural impact, and what we learned about pairing developers with AI. You'll walk away with a real-world perspective and a practical guide on how to scale AI-powered development across your engineering org�without the hype.
