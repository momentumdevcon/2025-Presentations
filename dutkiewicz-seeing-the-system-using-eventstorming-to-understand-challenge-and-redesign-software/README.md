# Seeing the System: Using EventStorming to Understand, Challenge, and Redesign Software

**Speaker:** Sarah Dutkiewicz

## Abstract

Whether you�re working with legacy systems, planning new features, or reviewing a team�s proposed data model, EventStorming is a powerful tool for surfacing what really matters in your architecture. In this session, you�ll learn how EventStorming has helped teams uncover the real scope of a project, reconstruct the logic behind legacy features, facilitate stakeholder conversations, and challenge questionable architectural assumptions.

We�ll walk through practical patterns and real examples: how to run effective sessions, what kinds of conversations to look for, and how to use EventStorming to bring clarity to both technical and business perspectives.

If you�re an architect or senior developer looking for ways to cut through complexity and design with confidence, this talk is for you.
