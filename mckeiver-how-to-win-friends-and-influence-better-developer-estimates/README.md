# How to Win Friends and Influence...Better Developer Estimates

**Speaker:** Brian McKeiver

## Abstract

Let's face it, creating estimates for tasks is not an exact science. Whether it is points, hours, level of effort, or whatever else the next fad is, it all mostly boils down to what feels like a shot in the dark. 

Join my session to find out a few lessons learned, tips, tricks, and strategies for creating accurate and timely estimates on your developer tasks. I'll share my experiences for creating the majority of estimates at my company for the past 18 years. I'd estimate that the amount of estimates I have created is more than 500 or so...see what I did there?   

At the end of the day, if you can create better estimates, than maybe your project managers will end up becoming another one of your long time friends.
