# From Developer to Decision-Maker: How to Build Executive Trust Without a Title

**Speaker:** Brett Leonard

## Abstract

Want a seat at the leadership table? It takes more than clean code.

In most organizations, leadership opportunities don�t go to the loudest or even the smartest�they go to the developers who consistently make good decisions and communicate in a way executives trust. The good news? It�s a skill you can learn.

In this talk, we�ll explore how to build trust with stakeholders, influence outcomes without a high-level title, and clearly communicate technical and strategic insights. I�ll share real-world examples of how developers positioned themselves as go-to decision-makers�and the habits, behaviors, and mindsets that helped them get there.

This talk is ideal for senior developers, aspiring tech leads, and engineers ready to step into more visible, impactful roles.
