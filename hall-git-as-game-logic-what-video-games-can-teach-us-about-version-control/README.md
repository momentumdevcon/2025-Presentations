# Git as Game Logic: What Video Games Can Teach Us About Version Control

**Speaker:** Bree Hall

## Abstract

Git can feel like a boss battle: confusing, punishing, and full of mechanics you weren�t properly warned about. But if you've ever played a video game, you already understand more about version control than you think. 

In this talk, we�ll reframe Git�s concepts through game design, from commit as your checkpoint save to stash as a quick inventory swap. Then we�ll level up: what does rebase have in common with timeline rewrites? Why is reflog your hidden save system? And why is force-pushing to main basically using cheat codes in co-op? 

Whether you�re early in your Git journey or managing complex workflows across teams, this talk will give you a new, more intuitive mental model for working with Git using the kind of logic games have taught us for years. You�ll leave with deeper insight into history, recovery, collaboration, and confidence, navigating even the trickiest parts of your version control quest.
