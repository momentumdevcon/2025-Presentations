# WTH is Chaos Engineering?! A Quick Look at Breaking Things on Purpose

**Speaker:** Kiah Imani

## Abstract

Why would anyone intentionally break their own systems? Welcome to chaos engineering.

In this fast-paced talk, we�ll demystify the what and why behind chaos engineering, no Netflix sized infrastructure required. You�ll learn how small experiments in failure can help you uncover blind spots, harden your systems, and sleep better at night.

We�ll look at real-world use cases, tools that make it easy to get started locally, and how to run chaos experiments without blowing up production. 

If you�ve ever shipped code with fingers crossed, this talk is for you.
