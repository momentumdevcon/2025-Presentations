# Building Better Tests: Lessons from Real World E2E Testing

**Speaker:** Avindra Fernando

## Abstract

Many companies use end-to-end testing to release high-quality software and stay competitive. With tools like Playwright and Cypress, testing web applications has become easier and more enjoyable.

As a software consultant, I have faced challenges that can make or break an E2E testing strategy. Slow tests caused by time-based waits, flaky failures due to async behavior, and brittle tests from unreliable selectors were just a few. Through experience, I have learned how to overcome these issues and help my clients build tests that are faster, more stable, and maintainable. 

In this session, I will share real-world lessons and simple techniques to avoid common testing pitfalls. You will walk away with practical strategies to write reliable tests and improve the overall quality of your applications.
